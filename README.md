# Linux Guide Book 
This repo is dedicated to Linux OS.


## What is [Linux](https://www.linux.org/)
Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

## User interface
The user interface, also known as the shell, is either a command-line interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems. For desktop systems, the default user interface is usually graphical, although the CLI is commonly available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console.

### Why Linux ?
The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open-source software.

### How to use it

### Caution!:
Modifying system properties is destructive, and can lead to loss of data. Not good! Remember to always backup your data before modifying anything on a live system.
